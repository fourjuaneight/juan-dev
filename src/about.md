Hi there. I'm Juan and I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them. I work independently as a freelancer, helping businesses make accessible and reliable static sites. When I'm not working, I'm likely still coding. There's always something for me to fix, optimize, or rebuild.

## Work
Most of my development career has been with static-site generators. Primarily Hugo and Gatsby. I'm not very good at talking about myself, so here are some nice lists:

**Languages:**
- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python

**Frameworks:**
- Gatsby
- Hugo
- Eleventy
- Jekyll
- Node

**Tooling:**
- Webpack
- Gulp
- Babel

There's likely several other stuff I know that I could list, but these are the main with which I work on a daily basis.

## Personal
There are many ways I could go about explaining who I am. But I feel a list is best. So here are some Juan facts for you:

- Born and raised in Florida. I live in DC now. I really miss the food and nicer people. Don't miss the heat. Or the fires. Or the hurricanes.
- If there's a remote chance I can automate it, I will try my hardest to do so. Even if it means I'll spend more time trying to automate the job than actually doing it. That's half the fun.
- I often think about False Vacuum and how everything could cease to exist at any moment.
- No other activity brings me more joy than cooking. My wife loves everything I make for her but I think she's biased.
- I worked in IT (mostly Networking) for a brief period. I hated it. Not the field (it's wonderful), but the act of doing it for a living.
- I was a paramedic some time ago. I delivered a baby once. It wasn't magical.
- Even though I understand how Facebook tracks my every move online, I can't help but think Instagram is listening in on my conversations.
- I've been with my same partner for as long as I can remember. It's awesome.
