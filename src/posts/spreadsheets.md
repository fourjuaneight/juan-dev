I like lists. I make them all the time to help me keep track of just about anything I need to know. There's only so much I can hold in my head at a given time. So offloading certain information for later use frees up my head to focus on executing tasks relating to the listed information.

That being said, I also make lists for mundane things. After some time, these became spreadsheets. And now, it's a sizable amount of [Airtables](https://airtable.com). I'm not sure why I make them. I guess I just want to keep track of things.

I have a pretty simple spreadsheet which keeps a record of my bookmarks. These are articles, podcasts, tweets, videos, and webcomics that I really like and want to reference at some point in the future. I don't think I ever have. But hey, they're there in case I need that information.

And I guess that's the whole reason for making these. If for whatever reason I'm in need of something I saw/heard/read at some point in the past, it's a couple of taps away. And not having to bear the mental burden of keep track of them in the head is nice.

Like [Merlon Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com) said in the last [Reconcilable Differences](https://www.relay.fm/rd) episode ([112](https://www.relay.fm/rd/112)), "it doesn't cost me very much at all to write these things down; it could cost me later in the future not to remember something".

I'm thinking of taking this a step further, though, and build out a PostgreSQL database for these things with an API for easy capture. I could make a nice table somewhere on this site to view them.
