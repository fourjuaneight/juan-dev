What the fuck is Boxing Day? It took me some time to figure out why this dumb holiday was. Everywhere I looked it just said where it came from, but not what the celebration actually is. I suppose that tells you how little people care about it and just want to figure out why it's in their calendars.

I've also always wondered how many people actually believe Christmas is the actual birthday of Christ. It's not, by the way. There's actually no record of it. However, the Bible hints at it taking place on a summer night. Seeing as Palestine is in the northern hemisphere, it's same to assume it was not during December.

It's winter and almost 70Â° outside. Can you believe this shit? I moved north to escape the heat. But here we are now with this shit weather. We should move to Canada.

Hi, I'm Juan. And after seeing some dude post a picture of all his monthly journals, I decided I should start writing one again. Why am I like this?

## Mood
It's been a roller coaster of a day in some ways. I had a rough night with Andrea waking up hungry in the middle of the night. But I also had a great morning cuddling and taking naps all morning. We had a great afternoon doing chores and fooling around. But then Andrea's interview left us still wondering if she got the position or not.

Needless to say, I feel a bit emotionally drained.
