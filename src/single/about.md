Hi, I'm Juan and I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them for strangers online. When I'm not working, I'm probably still coding.

## Work

Most of my development work is with the "JAMstack". Although these days I mostly jam with React. Here's a cool list of skills:

### Stack:
JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, Sass, HTML

### Frameworks:
React, Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll, Eleventy

### Tooling:
Node, Webpack, Gulp, Jest, Cypress, aXe, TravisCI, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, Gitlab/Bitbucket Pipeline

### Design Tools:
Sketch, Figma, InVision, Photoshop, Affinity Designer

### Other Skills:
Nunchuck, Bo Hunting, Computer Hacking

## Personal

Here's a nice list with some Juan facts for you:

- I automate all the things.
- I like cooking. My partner says I'm great, but I think she's biased.
- I was a paramedic once and delivered a baby. It wasn't magical.
- Florida man.
