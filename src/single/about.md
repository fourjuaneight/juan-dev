Hi there. I'm Juan and I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them. I work independently as a freelancer, helping businesses make accessible and reliable static sites. When I'm not working, I'm likely still coding. I do have a life. I just choose to ignore it and code all the time instead.

## Work

Most of my development career has been with static-site generators. Primarily Hugo and Gatsby. I'm not very good at talking about myself, so here are some nice lists:

**Languages:**

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- CSS
- Sass
- HTML

**Frameworks:**

- React
- Gatsby
- Hugo
- Jekyll
- Eleventy
- Node

**Tooling:**

- Webpack
- Gulp
- Babel
- Jest
- Cypress
- aXe
- TravisCI
- CircleCI
- GitHub Actions
- Gitlab/Bitbucket Pipeline

**Design Tools:**
- Sketch
- Figma
- InVision
- Photoshop
- Affinity Designer

There's likely several other stuff I know that I could list, but these are the main with which I work on a daily basis.

## Personal

There are many ways I could go about explaining who I am. But I feel a list is best. So here are some Juan facts for you:

- Born and raised in Florida. I live in DC now. I really miss the food and nicer people. Don't miss the heat. Or the fires. Or the hurricanes. But I don't like DC either.
- I like automating stuff. Most of the time I don't need to. A lot of the times I spend more time automating then what it'll actually save me in time.
- I consider myself to be great with Regular Expressions. I can't ever understand someone else's patterns though.
- I love cooking. My wife says I'm great, but I think she's biased.
- I was a paramedic some time ago. I delivered a baby once. It wasn't magical.
- Married. She's pretty cool.
