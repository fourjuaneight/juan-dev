Here's some of the stuff I use for work and procrastination.

## Hardware
### Desktop
- **iMac 27" (2019)** - A big Mac for making shiny squares look extra crispy.
- **[HHKB Pro 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K9QHF4P)** - I got the all-black keys and it took me a while to get used to the new layout without being able to tell which key is which. Worth every penny, though.
- **Magic Trackpad 2** - I tried several mice and the clicking was always unbearable. I don't think there's anything wrong with any of them, but there's definitely wrong with my ears.
- **[Audioengine A2+](https://audioengineusa.com/shop/poweredspeakers/a2-plus-desktop-speakers/)** - Not the best desktop speakers, but great for listening to podcasts while working.
- **[UpDesk Standing Desk](https://updesk.com/products/updesk-electric-lift-standing-desk-upwrite-midnight-black-top-on-black-frame-closeout)** - The table is pretty good, but the customer service is literally nonexistent.
- **[Secretlab Omega Chair](https://secretlab.co/collections/omega-series)** - Great chair.
- **[Tripp Lite 1500VA 900W UPS](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009TZTGWK/)** - I believe I heard about the brand from Marco Arment. Solid UPS.

### Mobile
- **iPhone 11 Pro ++ (white)** - Glorified podcast player with texting.
- **[Otterbox Traction ](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HNSM2ZM/A/otterbox-traction-series-case-for-iphone-11-pro-black-gray)** - Makes it look like a stormtrooper, but not really.
- **[D. Sloogs Pi sticker](https://dsloogs.bigcartel.com/product/space-maria-vinyl-set)** - Great artist.
- **AirPods Pro** - Got the [Ticci mod](https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-i-modded-the-silicone-tips-of-airpods-pro-with-a-memory-foam-layer/).

### Networking
- **[Ubiquiti USG Pro](https://store.ui.com/collections/routing-switching/products/unifi-security-gateway-pro)** - The only reason I got the Pro was to mount it on a rack.
- **[Ubiquiti UniFi Cloud Key Gen 2 Plus](https://store.ui.com/collections/surveillance/products/unifi-cloudkey-gen2-plus)** - I'm sure this is just a fancy overpriced Raspberry Pi.
- **[Ubiquiti UniFi 16 Port PoE Gen 2](https://store.ui.com/collections/routing-switching/products/usw-16-poe)** - Solid switch.
- **[Ubiquiti UniFi AC Pro](https://store.ui.com/collections/wireless/products/unifi-ac-pro)** - Solis access point.
- **Raspberry Pi ([PiHole](https://pi-hole.net))** - This is the best decision I made for my home network.

## Software
### Development
[Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com) all the things.

- **VS Code** - It's alright, but I'm curious to see what Panic does with [Nova](https://panic.com/nova/). Anything to get rid of another Electron app.
- **[iTerm](https://iterm2.com)** - Best macOS terminal.
- **[Blink](https://www.blink.sh)** - Best iOS terminal.
- **[Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com)** - I can't believe this is an iOS app; paramount for mobile Git-ing.
- **[Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/)** - Rarely use it, but it's nice to look at.
- **[ShellFish](https://secureshellfish.app)** - _The_ iOS FTP app.
- **[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)** - Who needs Photoshop.

### Productivity
I try my best to stay organized and mostly fail.

- **[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)** - I've tried them all and this UI is simply the best for me.
- **[Drafts](https://getdrafts.com)** - All text starts here.
- **[Jayson](https://jayson.app)** - Nice UI for JSON on iOS.
- **[Scriptable](https://scriptable.app)** - Some times you just need a little JavaScript.

### Tools
- **[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)** - Spotlight is great and Launchbar is nicer looking, but you can't beat the customizability of Alfred.
- **[Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/)** - A computer should run itself. This does the trick.
- **[Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/)** - Nifty little window manager.
- **[Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)** - Too much crap on the menu bar.

### Media
- **[Overcast](https://overcast.fm)** - I always go back and forth between this and [Castro](https://castro.fm). I love the former for its quality build, but the latter has a terrific UI.
- **[Reeder](https://reederapp.com)** - Paired with [Feed Wrangler](https://feedwrangler.net), though I'm starting to miss [Feedbin's](https://feedbin.com) powerful filters.
- **[Apollo](https://apolloapp.io)** (Reddit)

For an even nerdier list, take a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/dotfiles) and see into the soul of my Mac.
