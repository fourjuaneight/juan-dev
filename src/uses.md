I try to keep my development environment as minimal as possible. There's a lot of stuff that I've replaced with tools I made myself.

## Editor + Terminal
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) has been my main editor for some time. I was Vim user for a long time, but you can't beat the easy setup and customization of VSCode.
- [Hyper](https://hyper.is) is there and I hardly ever use it. I spend so much time in the editor that I just use the integrated terminal.
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org) all the way.
- Occasionally I'll have to design a little something for work. When I do, I always use [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/). I've had it since day one and wouldn't change it for anything.
- If it's code I'm looking at, it's with [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) as my font.
- Huge fan of [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com).

If you want more on my dev environment, take a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/fourjuaneight/dotfiles).

## Office
- I got an [UpDesk](https://updesk.com) motorized standing desk. But hardly ever stand. I'm always getting up for something.
- My chair is a [SecretLab Omega](https://secretlab.co/collections/omega-series) gaming chair. It's pretty nice.

There's a lot of gaming stuff in here. The only thing I actually ever play is Minecraft. On my phone.
