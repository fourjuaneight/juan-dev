There are many ways I could go about explaining who I am and what I do. But I feel a list is the best way to go. So here are some Juan facts for ya:

1. I'm a Southern guy (Florida) with Latino parents. I live in DC now. I really miss the food and nicer people. Don't miss the heat. Or the fires. Or the hurricanes.
2. I love technology and everything about it. But mostly, I'm lazy and I like having the ability to make computers do everything they can for me.
3. Speaking of, I'm an automation nerd. I don't know any Python, yet there are dozens of Python scripts running all the time in my computer handling anything that needs to happen more than once on some sort of schedule.
4. I would call myself an enthusiast, but rather a lover of physics and astronomy. Code bugs no longer keep me up at night knowing there's plenty of things outside our little planet that can annihilate us at any moment.
5. No other activity brings me more joy than cooking.
6. I worked in IT (mostly Networking) for some years. I hated it. Not the field (it's wonderful), but the act of doing it for a living.
7. I was a paramedic once upon a time. I delivered a baby. It wasn't magical.
8. I'm an Apple fanboy with a Linux PC I built. Mac's really suck nowadays.
9. I'm always looking for creative ways to avoid having my every digital move monitored. It's fun, but also, it's absurd how many things track us online.
10. I'm married and have been with the same partner for as long as I can remember. It's awesome.

## Colophon
I am not a designer. I take a lot of inspiration from developers I admire and appreciate their creative eye. So you will see a lot of "inspiration" from others here. Though I will say that the finished look of the site happened very organically as I was making it.

The site's look and feel was heavily influenced by {{< link href="https://jeremy.codes/" content="Jeremy Wagner's" >}} site. The terminal looking header was lifted from {{< link href="http://adrianroselli.com/" content="Adrian Roselli's" >}} code blocks. The color scheme is 100% {{< link href="https://draculatheme.com//" content="Dracula Theme" >}}.
