I love the web. From the first time I got online around 2000 on my first Mac (G3 Grape!), I thought about the possibilities of having answers to anything at my fingertips. The early web had a sense of discovery and adventure. And although that's been mostly lost with today's infinite news feed, I do my best to experience the web through recommendations by bloggers and internet peoples.

The reason I loved going online so much from the very beginning was that it only required a computer and an internet connection. You didn't need to be special. No matter your orientation, preferences or appearance. When I make a site, I try to keep that spirit alive. I want anyone, regardless of who and where they are, to be able to enjoy what I made. So I do my best to make the experience accessible to anyone. And not just accessible to anyone regardless of physical challenges, but also technical ones. If you're rocking 3G, I got you. If you're using a screen reader, no worries, I got alt text for days. Color contrast? Of course.

But sadly these things aren't a priority to everyone. It's easy to overlook them when you've always experienced the web without impairments. So I do my best to also orient business owners and creators in the best practices for an accessible site for all. And how to keep them that way. I don't always succeed, but I try my hardest.

I'm not an accessibility expert. My focus has always been fast and modular static sites. It still is. But I'm always learning new ways to also make my work accessible.

## Technologies
**TL;DR**

- Hugo
- Gatsby
- Jekyll
- Webpack
- Gulp
- Babel
- ESLint
- Prettier

As I mentioned before, I focus on static sites. These means working with SSGs (static-site generators) like **{{< link href="https://gohugo.io" content="Hugo" >}}**, **{{< link href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org" content="Gatsby" >}}**, and **{{< link href="https://jekyllrb.com" content="Jekyll" >}}**. Most of my work is with Hugo. Businesses enjoy the speed and ease of use as it stays true to its "static site" nature and renders clean and semantic HTML/CSS/JS.

I tend to use **Webpack** + **Babel** for my JavaScript as it ensures compatibility across browsers. I favor **vanilla JavaScript** over third party libraries. **Gulp** also plays a big part in my work for critical CSS and **Sass**. These are always paired with **ESLint** and **Prettier**.

However, I'm doing more and more work nowadays with Gatsby because of its React core. For many teams already working with a React stack, having a Gatsby marketing front-end just makes more sense for maintainability. And the tech has grown substantially with a lot of community support, which is always a sign of a great future.

## About Me
There are many ways I could go about explaining who I am. But I feel a list is best. So here are some Juan facts for you:

1. I'm a Southern guy (Florida) with Latino parents. I live in DC now. I really miss the food and nicer people. Don't miss the heat. Or the fires. Or the hurricanes.
2. I love technology and everything about it. But mostly, I'm lazy and I like having the ability to make computers do everything they can for me.
3. Speaking of, I'm an automation nerd. I don't know any Python, but there are dozens of Python scripts running all the time in my PC. I have a few JavaScript and Python scripts on my iPhone as well that help with some of the work-related tasks and a lot of text editing.
4. I wouldn't call myself an enthusiast, but rather a lover of physics and astronomy. Now whenever there's a code bug stuck in my head at night, I think about False Vacuum and how everything could easily cease to exist at any moment.
5. No other activity brings me more joy than cooking. My wife loves everything I make for her but I think she's biased.
6. I worked in IT (mostly Networking) for some years. I hated it. Not the field (it's wonderful), but the act of doing it for a living.
7. I was a paramedic once upon a time. I delivered a baby. It wasn't magical.
8. I'm an Apple fanboy with a Linux PC I built. Mac's really suck nowadays.
9. I'm always looking for creative ways to avoid having my every digital move monitored. It's fun, but also, it's absurd how many things track us online.
10. I'm married and have been with the same partner for as long as I can remember. It's awesome.
