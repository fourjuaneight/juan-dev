I am not a designer. I take a lot of inspiration from developers I admire and appreciate their creative eye. So you will see a lot of "inspiration" from others here.

The site's look and feel was heavily influenced by [Matthias Ott's](https://matthiasott.com/) site. The color scheme is 100% [Dracula Theme](https://draculatheme.com/).
